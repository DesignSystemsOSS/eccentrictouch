# Margins

Margins are created in the form of utility classes for all the dimensions (all-sides, top, bottom, right, left.)

## How it's working?

- `m-{value}`: For giving margins at all the sides. For example, `m-4` will give margin of `4 units` (i.e. 25.648px as 1 unit is created by this formula: {value} * 4px * 1.618)

## How to use it?

- For margin at **all the sides** - `m-{value}`
- For margin at **right side** - `m-right-{value}`
- For margin at **left side** - `m-left-{value}`
- For margin at **top side** - `m-top-{value}`
- For margin at **bottom side** - `m-bottom-{value}`
